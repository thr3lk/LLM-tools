# Planning to learn: making a research plan
So you’re about to do some research… make a plan first 🙂

This quick-guide is intented to help product managers, designers, and other non-expert researchers start a research project off with solid framing to achieve successful research outcomes.

# What is a research plan and why should I write one?
At a high level a research plan is a document that outlines what you know you don’t know and lists the strategies you intend to use to get those questions answered.

Having a research plan in place is important to the success of your research and will help ensure quality results. A research plan provides a framework that helps stakeholders and collaborators understand why your investment of time and resource will be valuable. It also sets the stage for proper expectations for the outcomes of a research or discovery initiative. A good research plan helps frame your insights appropriately and cautions against misapplying your what you learn.

Most importantly, it helps you and your immediate team identify the most important questions to answer at your current phase of work, going beyond "do users like this solution" or "what problems do users have" to lines of inquiry that result in actionable insights.

A research plan is not an interview script or a usability test plan. A research plan might have multiple studies, scripts, or protocols, all using various research methods, but it provides a centralized place to collect all of your protocols, summarize the results.

# Okay, sold, how do I write one?
## First, assess where you are in the design process
Research can and should take place throughout the entire design cycle, but it’s most relevant at the beginning, middle, and end 🙂

Knowing where you are in the process helps you pick the appropriate type of research for your needs

- Foundational research builds empathy and generates insights through loosely structured discovery. Use foundational research sparingly, only when you're entering an entirely new problem space or market.
- Generative research helps identify oppportunites and solution ideas within an problem space
- Formative research helps you understand if your concepts or potential approaches are working to meet the user needs or not and results in actionable insights that guide refinments to your approach. A process of idea -> test -> iterate -> test -> repeat helps to formulate a better approach
- Summative or sometimes "evaluative" research measures success against defined metrics like time-to-task or completion rate. This is usually the last step in a proces and is often done via User Acceptance Testing, Usability Testing, or through in-situ testing like multivariate A/B tests or post-change KPI monitoring

## Next, gather your context

### Identify stakeholders
No research is done in a vacuum, and it can dangerous (or at least lonely) to go alone. Who should come on this journey of discovery with you? Who can help you ask better questions? Who might be interested or invested in the outcomes?

At the beginning of any research project, I like to spend an hour with my stakeholders and extended project team, just listing assumptions we need to test and questions we want to get answered. We put those into a shared document and keep adding and refining throughout the life of the project.

Make sure to understand project timelines, deadlines, and key dates.

### Look for questions that already have answers
Many of your initial questions will have readily available answers. Some answers might be a slack message away, who can you ask for context? What existing researcvh ahs already been done? A quick search of our Dovetail research repository can provide a sense of what is already known.


### Eliminate questions that don't need answers
After an initial sweep of what we already know, some of questions may feel partially answered, or you might think the answer is incomplete or otherwise untrustworthy. Many of these areas may benefit from additional research, but occasionally it's better to take them as assumptions and not spend additional time.

An example here might be something foundational to the company strategy that you're unconvinced of, but that may require a larger project to re-examine. If you're not doing foundational research, it's best to leave foundational questions alone. Similarly, if you're doing summative research on a final approach, it may be misplaced effort to re-examine whether users actually have the problem being solved — the original research that led to prioritizing this problem is typically sufficient even if you're slightly skeptical.

## Define your goal
Armed with a list of open questions and assumption, you likely have a decent understanding of what you, your team, and your stakeholders want out of the research. Or maybe you have a few potential goals in mind. Regardless, refine your goal to a single, well defined statement that you and your stakeholders agree on.

To refine your goal, it helps to ask questions like:

What are you trying to do?

- Move a project forward
- Get a new perspective
- Solve a problem
- something else entirely?

Is the primary goal actionable insights or innovation insights?

What decisions will you make with the research?
- Are you deciding between two well understood solutions? (you might doing formative or summative research)
- Are you trying to decide what questions to answer next? (you might be doing foundational research)


Are you looking for ideas? (you might be doing generative research)

A summative or evaluative goal might be something like:
> validate that a new date picker design matches user expectations and is fit for use.

A formative goal might be something like:
> identify opportuities to address known issues with the current date picker

or, better:
> detemine where and why user are stuggling with the current date picker


Foundational goals are tricky and often best done in collaboration with a researcher and high level stakeholders, usually execuitives. If you think foundational research is needed, reach out to the team to get that process started.

## Now write your questions
If you’re doing this right, you should have a list of questions that you want to get answered about a mile long. Narrow that down down to three to five high-level questions.

These questions will guide your research and might take the form of
- high level themes of inquiry
- specific questions that you want to get answered
- a hypothesis to test
- a metric or other key measurement to compare between cohorts or over time

Look for ways to group multiple questions into one questions or refine a question to cover more ground. Look for high value questions behind the questions, or what some people call eigenquestions, that if answered will help answer a large portion of the the other questions.

These key questions, your top level goal, and outline of existing research all combine to form a research frame. This frame lets you know when you're "done" with research.

## Design your research approach
This should be your last step. Look over your list research fram pick research methods or experiments that could help you answer each one. A question might be answered by more than one method. More than one question might be answered by the same activity.
