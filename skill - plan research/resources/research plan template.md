## Research goals & learning objectives
This is the most important part of the plan and should be well developed before continuing on to planning or selecting your methodology. This section is also sometimes called the reseach frame.

It should consist of at least a few bullet points about what you intend to learn as a part of this research or discovery activity. Where relevant, include hypothesised outcomes to test. It's also helpful to include why certain information is important to learn.


## Sample criteria
A few bullet points about who you want to have participate in this activity, or other notes about how you’ll sample the data you plan to use.

## Protocol
Here you describe what you’ll do to collect your data. This is often simple, something like “customer interviews, 30 minutes” and then a list of questions. Sometimes it can be a bit more complex, like a survey with conditional questions and a weighting model you’ll use to process the results.

This section will vary widely depending on the type of activity you’re doing. It should be the very last part you develop.
